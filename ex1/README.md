This was my first practical of my final year in undergrad. The aim of this `python` practical was to aid my understanding of file systems and how much of a pain it used to be to elicit information. 

Download the following csv file([world.csv][world]) which countains thousands of entries relating to different countries.

The task is to answer the following questions:

1. How many capital cities end with the letter 'e'?
2. List the capital cities that end with the letter 'e' (without any repetitions)?
3. **How many** countries gained independence between 1950 and 1970 (inclusive)?
4. **Which** countries gained independence between 1830 and 1850 (inclusive)?
5. What are the 5 most commonly spoken languages in the world?
6. List the 5 largest countries by surface area.
7. List the 5 **African** countries with the lowest life expectancy.
8. Which head of state rules the most countries?

The Program should output the answers in the following format:

```
Question 1:
[Answer]
Question 2:
[Answer]
```

It was a pain not being allowed to use `SQL` queries but hey they don't expect you to go the extra mile these days. I guess the idea is to make you realise how tedious the job used to be so you can appreciate `SQL` more further down the line.
